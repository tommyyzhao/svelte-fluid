# Changelog

All notable changes to **svelte-fluid** are documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **patch** — bug fixes, doc fixes, internal refactors
- **minor** — new presets, new props, additive engine features
- **major** — breaking API changes

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`autoAnimateDuration` prop** on `FluidStick` — controls how many seconds
  auto-animation runs before stopping. Default 3.5s. Once stopped, off-mask dye
  fades away, revealing the sticky shape. Set to 0 for indefinite animation.
- **Color-cycling auto-animate** — `FluidStick` auto-animation now cycles through
  rainbow hues (HSV rotation at 2×t) at 1.5× HDR intensity, replacing the fixed
  purple `{r:0.3, g:0.15, b:0.3}` color. Produces vivid accumulated dye.

### Changed

- **FluidStick default tuning** — `splatRadius` 0.25→0.6 (thicker cursor splats),
  `splatForce` 6000→10000 (brighter splats), `densityDissipation` 0.85→0.78
  (faster off-mask fade), `amplify` 0.3→0.5 (stronger on-mask boost).
- **FluidStick auto-animate timing** — deferred clock start (`animStartTime` set
  on first available frame, not mount time) so lazy-loaded cards get the full
  animation duration. Fixed Lissajous to use `t` variable (was using raw ms,
  ignoring `autoAnimateSpeed`). Wider vertical sweep (±0.27 vs ±0.2).
- **Demo sticky text card** — changed text from "STICKY" (bold 80px) to "FLUID"
  (900-weight 120px) for bolder letterforms.

### Known Issues

- **Sticky mask texture GPU sampling bug** — the mask texture is created correctly
  (verified: non-zero pixel data, correct GPU readback R=255), and the engine
  config is correct (STICKY=true, uniforms exist). However, `texture2D(uStickyMask, uv).r`
  returns 0 in the advection shader. A hardcoded `step()` mask pattern DOES work,
  confirming the dissipation logic is correct. Root cause is a texture sampler
  binding issue that needs investigation. Pre-existing from session 13.

- **`FluidStick` component** (`FluidStick.svelte`, ~210 LOC) — new Svelte wrapper
  that makes fluid dye "stick" to text or SVG path shapes. Three physics-level
  shader modulations: advection dissipation (dye persists on mask), pressure
  injection (fluid flows around mask), splat amplification (more dye deposited
  on mask). Props: `text`, `font`, `d`, `maskViewBox`, `maskFillRule`,
  `maskResolution`, `maskBlur`, `strength`, `stickyPressureAmount`, `amplify`,
  `autoAnimate`, `autoAnimateSpeed`.
- **`StickyMask` type** (`types.ts`) — describes the mask shape for sticky mode.
  Supports text mode (`text` + `font`) and SVG path mode (`d` + `viewBox`).
  Same rasterization pattern as `ContainerShape.svgPath` text mode.
- **Sticky shader uniforms** — `uStickyMask`/`uStickyStrength` added to advection
  shader, `uStickyMask`/`uStickyPressure` to pressure shader,
  `uStickyMask`/`uStickyAmplify` to splat shader. All default to 0.0 (identity)
  when sticky is disabled — zero performance cost for non-sticky instances.
- **`FluidConfig` sticky fields** — `sticky` (Bucket B), `stickyMask` (triggers
  texture rebuild), `stickyStrength` (Bucket A, default 0.9),
  `stickyPressure` (Bucket A, default 0.15), `stickyAmplify` (Bucket A, default 0.3).
- **Sticky mask texture** — `initStickyMaskTexture()` in FluidEngine rasterizes
  text/SVG path via OffscreenCanvas, extracts alpha channel, optional box blur,
  uploads as R8/LUMINANCE texture on unit 7. Includes `blurMaskData()` for
  multi-pass box blur approximating Gaussian.
- **`stickyMaskEqual()`** — deep equality for StickyMask values, exported from
  `container-shapes.ts`. Also exported `viewBoxEqual()`.
- **Demo: Sticky section** — 4 cards (Sticky text, Lightning bolt, Sticky + circle,
  Strong pressure) on the demo page.
- **34 new tests** (`sticky.test.ts`) — advection dissipation modulation, pressure
  injection, splat amplification, StickyMask equality, viewBoxEqual, config types.
- **`FluidDistortion` component** — new Svelte wrapper that uses the fluid
  velocity field to warp an underlying image. Cursor movement creates liquid
  ripple distortions. Props: `src`, `strength`, `intensity`, `fit`, `scale`,
  `bleed`, `initialSplats`, `autoDistort`, `autoDistortSpeed`.
- **`DISTORTION` display shader keyword** — mutually exclusive with `REVEAL`
  via `#elif`. Reads `dye.r` as distortion intensity, `velocity.xy` as
  direction, offsets image UVs by `normalize(vel) * dye.r * power`.
  Supports cover/contain fit modes and configurable scale.
- **Distortion bleed** — `bleed` prop (CSS pixels, default 60) extends the
  canvas invisibly beyond each edge. The fluid velocity field flows freely
  past the visible boundaries instead of bouncing. Image UVs are remapped
  to the visible sub-region via `uBleed` uniform.
- **Initial chaos splats** — `initialSplats` prop (default 20) generates
  random high-velocity splats at construction. Combined with
  `initialDensityDissipation: 0.5` ramp over 2 seconds, creates a dramatic
  warp-to-clear transition on load.
- **FluidConfig distortion fields** — `distortion`, `distortionPower`,
  `distortionImageUrl`, `distortionFit`, `distortionScale`,
  `distortionBleedX`, `distortionBleedY`. Bucket B (keyword) for
  `distortion` boolean, Bucket A (hot scalar) for all others.
- **Distortion image texture** — `loadDistortionImage()` in `FluidEngine`
  loads image URLs asynchronously and uploads as GL texture. Handles CORS,
  stale load cancellation, and context restore re-loading.
- **Demo: Distortion section** — 4 cards (Image distortion, Auto-distort,
  Strong warp, Contained with shape) using Bosch's *Garden of Earthly
  Delights* (public domain, 1490–1500).
- **14 new tests** (`distortion.test.ts`) — UV offset math, edge alpha,
  bleed remapping, config defaults, mutual exclusivity with REVEAL.
- **ADR-0030** — documents FluidDistortion architecture decisions.

### Changed

- **Multiplicative velocity dissipation override** — when `REVEAL` or `STICKY`
  enables multiplicative advection mode, velocity dissipation is overridden
  to 0.98 instead of using `VELOCITY_DISSIPATION` (default 0.2) which would
  kill velocity at 80% per frame in multiplicative mode.
- **Ksenia Kondrashova acknowledgment** — README Acknowledgments section now
  credits her CodePen demos as inspiration for the reveal and distortion effects.

### Fixed

- **Text mask glyph centering** (`FluidEngine.ts`) — `textBaseline` was set to
  `'middle'` after `measureText`, so ascent/descent were measured from the
  alphabetic baseline but drawing used the em-square midpoint. Glyphs like `&`
  were visually off-center and clipped. Now uses `textBaseline: 'alphabetic'`
  for both measurement and drawing, with explicit `(ascent - descent) / 2`
  offset for true visual centering.
- **Rectangle shape not restoring** — switching the shape dropdown back to
  Rectangle did nothing because `containerShape` derived returned `undefined`,
  which `resolveConfig` skips (line 181: `if (input.containerShape !== undefined)`).
  Changed to return `null`, which the engine correctly processes as "clear shape".
- **Glass shape auto-switch not reversible** — enabling glass forced
  `containerShapeType` to `roundedRect` with no way back. Now remembers the
  pre-glass shape in `shapeBeforeGlass` and restores it when glass is unchecked.
- **7 missing URL hash serialization variables** — `randomSplatDx`, `randomSplatDy`,
  `randomSplatEvenSpacing`, `revealAutoRevealSpeed`, `revealContent`,
  `revealCoverColor`, `revealAccentColor` were silently lost when sharing
  playground URLs. Added to `serializeState()`, `deserializeState()`, and the
  hash-push `$effect` tracking array.

### Changed

- **Playground label overhaul** — all checkbox labels standardized to sentence
  case: bloom→Bloom, glass→Glass, shading→Shading, sunrays→Sunrays,
  transparent→Transparent, paused→Paused, splatOnHover→Splat on hover,
  fadeBack→Fade back, autoReveal→Auto-reveal, colorful→Cycle colors.
  Shape dropdown: circle→Circle, frame→Frame, roundedRect→Rounded rect,
  annulus→Ring. "shape" label→"Shape". glassChromatic→"Color fringing".
  autoRevealSpeed→"Auto-reveal speed".
- **"Annulus" renamed to "Ring"** throughout user-facing UI — dropdown label,
  card title, card description, PRESET_CONFIGS key, Portal ring description.
  Internal `type: 'annulus'` in ContainerShape API unchanged.
- **Shape "none" → "Rectangle"** — dropdown label for the default full-canvas
  mode now reads "Rectangle" instead of "none".
- **Glass + Rectangle** — "Rectangle" option disabled when glass is on with
  tooltip "Glass requires a container shape". Glass auto-switches to
  `roundedRect` as fallback.
- **densityDissipation moved to Physics section** — removed from quick-controls
  bar, added at top of Physics accordion body.
- **Paused moved to quick controls** — moved from Visuals accordion to the
  quick-controls row alongside Bloom and Glass.
- **Container Shape accordion hidden when Rectangle** — no empty section shown
  when there are no shape parameters to configure.
- **bloomIntensity/sunraysWeight conditionally visible** — sliders hidden when
  their parent effect (bloom/sunrays) is off.
- **initialDensityDissipation help text** — added field hint explaining
  construct-only semantics. Duration label changed to "Ramp duration (s)".
- **Comprehensive jargon cleanup** across all card descriptions and extra routes:
  - "Snell's law refraction" → "optical refraction"
  - "analytical shapes" → "built-in shapes"
  - "Hemisphere dome with chromatic aberration" → "Glass sphere with rainbow color fringing"
  - "Fresnel" → "soft edge reflections"
  - "Chromatic rim refraction" → "Rainbow light bending"
  - "volumetric bloom" → "a soft glow"
  - "High curl, instant velocity decay" → "Strong swirl, instant slowdown"
  - "India ink" → "Deep blue ink"
  - "Set fadeBack={false}" → "Disable fade-back"
  - "Lissajous animation" → "automated cursor traces a pattern"
  - "Navier-Stokes" → "Fluid Simulation" (background-fluid page)
  - "annuli" → "rings", "rounded rects" → "rounded rectangles"
  - "Post-processing pass with Snell refraction, Fresnel specular highlights, and chromatic aberration" → "Glass lens effect with light bending, reflective highlights, and rainbow color fringing"

### Added

- **`<ToroidalTempest>` preset** — 6th visual preset. Full-spectrum storm
  circulating in an annular ring with high-velocity (V=300) tangential splats,
  curl=50, periodic re-injection every 2s. Fills the odd-count gap in the
  2-column preset grid.
- **Playground Fluid/Reveal mode toggle** — pill toggle switches between
  `<Fluid>` canvas and `<FluidReveal>` wrapping actual sample content
  (gradient+text or tile mosaic). Reveal mode shows the real scratch-to-reveal
  interaction with content underneath.
- **Accordion ControlPanel** — 7 collapsible sections (Physics, Random Splats,
  Visuals, Resolution, Background, Container Shape, Glass) with blue "N changed"
  badges on each header. Pinned quick-controls bar always shows curl,
  splatRadius, densityDissipation, bloom, glass, shape picker.
- **"Customize" button on demo cards** — every preset, config, and glass effect
  card has a Customize button that loads its config into the playground and
  scrolls to it. Uses `loadConfig()` which resets to defaults first, then
  applies overrides.
- **URL hash state** — playground state serialized to `#pg=<base64 JSON>` via
  `history.replaceState` (debounced 300ms). Covers all physics, glass sub-params,
  container shape sub-params, reveal settings. "Share" button copies URL.
  Back button works as undo.
- **`revealCoverColor` prop** (`FluidConfig`, `FluidReveal.coverColor`) —
  customizable cover color for the reveal layer. The display shader replaces
  the hardcoded `1.0` with `uRevealCoverColor`, preserving identical default
  behavior (white). Bucket A.
- **`FluidReveal.accentColor` prop** — controls the iridescent fringe color at
  scratch edges. Derived as `coverColor - accentColor` → dye injection color,
  so the shader's `max(coverColor - c, 0)` naturally produces the accent at
  full dye. No engine uniform needed; lives entirely in FluidReveal.
- **Customize on all remaining cards** — Default, Circle, Frame, Annulus,
  Rounded frame, SVG path, Text glyph, Portal ring, Glass frame, and all 4
  Reveal cards now have Customize buttons + `PRESET_CONFIGS` entries. Reveal
  cards switch playground to Reveal mode.
- **`</>` code preview toggle** — replaces "Copy code" button in ControlPanel
  with a `</>` toggle showing an inline code panel with Copy button. Floating
  `</>` button in page top-right shows FluidBackground usage snippet.
- **Share button "Copied!" feedback** — 1.8s flash after clicking Share.
- **Card copy button "Copied!" feedback** — same pattern on all demo cards.
- **Physics snapshot on mode switch** — switching to Reveal mode snapshots
  curl/velocityDissipation/splatRadius/bloom/sunrays/shading and applies
  reveal defaults; switching back restores the snapshot.
- **SVG path Customize support** — `customContainerShape` state in playground
  allows svgPath shapes loaded via Customize, cleared when user picks a
  shape from the dropdown.
- **Code snippets show full `<Fluid>` equivalents** — every preset card snippet
  now shows both the preset shorthand and the equivalent `<Fluid>` configuration
  with all physics props.
- **Reveal snippets include exact CSS** — all 4 reveal card snippets include
  gradient stops, layout styles, and FluidReveal props.

### Fixed

- **Playground reveal mode was broken** — toggling `reveal={true}` on `<Fluid>`
  showed transparency to the page background with nothing to reveal. Now uses
  actual `<FluidReveal>` wrapping sample content.
- **`loadConfig` dirty state bleed** — loading a preset config left previous
  state (e.g., randomSplatRate, glass settings) from prior customization.
  Now calls `resetAllDefaults()` before applying overrides.
- **`buildRevealSnippet` wrong defaults** — compared against hardcoded
  FluidReveal defaults instead of the playground's `D.*` defaults, producing
  misleading code output with spurious "changed" props.
- **`reset()` didn't reset playground mode** — clicking Reset in Reveal mode
  reset all sliders but stayed in Reveal mode. Now resets to Fluid mode.
- **Shape badge only counted type change** — now counts sub-param changes
  (cx, cy, radius, innerRadius, outerRadius) in the badge number.
- **Glass accordion hint was passive text** — "Enable glass in quick controls
  above" is now a clickable button that sets `glass = true`.
- **Stale preset count copy** — "Eight presets" updated to "six visual presets
  and four shape presets" in page copy and og:description.
- **Label audit** — "evenSpacing" → "Even spacing", "show outline" →
  "Show shape outline".
- **`controlsRef` typed properly** — uses `FluidHandle` import instead of
  inline type.

### Changed

- **Plasma preset reverted** to original rectangular canvas design — 8 inward
  compass-point jets converging at center, `randomSplatRate={0.4}`, no container
  shape. The annulus ring design moved to ToroidalTempest.
- **PRESET_CONFIGS enriched** — added `initialDensityDissipation`,
  `initialDensityDissipationDuration` to LavaLamp/Plasma/ToroidalTempest;
  `randomSplatSpread`/`randomSplatSwirl` to Crystal orb;
  `randomSplatCount` to Soft lens.

- **Multiplicative dissipation for reveal mode** (ADR-0028) — advection shader
  now supports `uniform float uMultiplicative`. When `reveal=true`, the engine
  sets it to 1.0, switching from `result / (1 + dissipation * dt)` to
  `dissipation * result`, matching the Ascend-Fluid reference physics.
- **Hemisphere rim effects via `glassThickness`** — the circle glass model now
  uses `uGlassThickness` to boost refraction displacement, rim specular, and
  rim glow at the dome edge. Previously `glassThickness` was unused for circles.
- **Curl skip optimization** — `step()` skips curl + vorticity compute passes
  when `CURL === 0`, saving 2 draw calls per frame for reveal and flat configs.

### Fixed

- **FluidReveal y-coordinate inversion** — the manual pointer handler passed
  DOM-space y (0=top) to `engine.splat()` which expects GL-space y (0=bottom).
  Splats now appear where the cursor actually is.
- **FluidReveal CSS sizing** — `.svelte-fluid-reveal` and its content div now
  set `width: 100%; height: 100%` so the component fills its parent container.
- **Lazy teardown releases WebGL context slots** (`Fluid.svelte`) — after
  `engine.dispose()`, lazy instances now call `loseContext()` via the
  `WEBGL_lose_context` extension to free the browser's context slot (~16 cap).
- **Text-mode mask sizing** — `initMaskTexture()` text height now uses
  `actualBoundingBoxAscent + actualBoundingBoxDescent` instead of a hardcoded
  `refSize * 1.2`, fixing glyph clipping at large font sizes.

### Changed

- **FluidReveal display shader** — output changed from premultiplied flat
  cover color `vec4(coverColor * alpha, alpha)` to non-premultiplied inverted
  dye `vec4(1.0 - c, alpha)`. Produces sharp iridescent fringes at reveal
  edges matching the Ascend-Fluid reference.
- **FluidReveal physics defaults** — fully revised for multiplicative mode:
  - `sensitivity`: 0.12 → **0.1** (matches reference `pow(0.1 * a, 0.1)`)
  - `velocityDissipation`: 3 → **0.9** (multiplicative: 90% retention/frame)
  - `splatRadius`: 0.4 → **0.2** (tighter reveal strokes)
  - `REVEAL_DYE`: `{0.15, 0.15, 0.15}` → `{0.95, 0.84, 0.68}` (non-uniform
    warm dye creates blue-tinted iridescent fringes when inverted)
  - `fadeBack` dissipation: 0.97 → **0.995** (multiplicative slow fade)
  - permanent dissipation: 0 → **1.0** (multiplicative no-fade)
- **`coverColor` prop removed** from `FluidRevealProps`, `FluidConfig`,
  `ResolvedConfig`, and the display shader uniform. The inverted-dye approach
  replaces it.
- **`revealSensitivity` default**: 0.12 → **0.1** (engine + component).
- **Preset modernization** — all presets now use container shapes and
  latest features:
  - **LavaLamp**: added `roundedRect` container + `glass` (rim refraction)
  - **Plasma**: changed to `annulus` container, 8 tangential ring splats with
    periodic re-injection (2.5s interval with positional jitter),
    `velocityDissipation: 0.02`
  - **InkInWater**: full rewrite — dark water background, volumetric bloom,
    shading, 5 chromatically varied ink droplets, physics tuned for
    realistic ink-in-water behavior
  - **FrozenSwirl**: added `circle` container
  - **SvgPathFluid**: changed from star path to bold ampersand "&" glyph
    using text-mode rasterization with `fillRule: 'evenodd'`
- **Demo page Container shapes** — swapped Rounded frame / Rounded rect order;
  replaced Rounded rect with SVG path lightning bolt; renamed SVG star card
  to "Text glyph".
- **Demo page Container effects** — Crystal orb gets `glassThickness={0.08}`;
  Soft lens gets faster splats (`rate: 2.5`, `count: 2`, lower dissipation);
  Glass frame gets much faster splats (`rate: 3.0`, `count: 2`,
  `randomSplatSwirl={350}`).
- **Semantic language audit** — replaced "plasma", "energy field", "tokamak",
  "confined/confinement" with accurate fluid terminology across all presets,
  demo cards, types.ts JSDoc, README, CHANGELOG, ADRs, and learnings docs.

### Removed

- **`/ascend-fluid` route** (~650 LOC) — standalone reference implementation,
  obsolete now that FluidReveal matches its physics.
- **`coverColor` / `revealCoverColor`** — prop, config field, engine default,
  resolveConfig mapping, shader uniform, and all demo page usage.

### Previously added

- **`<FluidReveal>` component** — fluid simulation as an opacity mask over
  slotted content. Cursor movement injects dye which the `REVEAL` display
  shader converts to transparency, revealing children underneath. Props:
  `coverColor`, `sensitivity`, `curve`, `fadeBack`, `fadeSpeed`, `autoReveal`,
  `autoRevealSpeed`, `lazy`, `autoPause`. See ADR-0027.
- **`reveal` display mode** (engine-level) — new `REVEAL` keyword in the
  display shader outputs premultiplied `vec4(coverColor * alpha, alpha)`.
  New config fields: `reveal` (Bucket B), `revealCoverColor`,
  `revealSensitivity`, `revealCurve` (all Bucket A).
- **`/fluid-reveal/` demo route** — 5 test instances: default reveal, custom
  cover color, auto-reveal animation, soft edges, circular reveal zone.
- **Reveal section on main demo page** — 4 cards (scratch-to-reveal, permanent
  reveal, auto-reveal, soft reveal) with code snippets. All lazy.
- ADR-0027: FluidReveal — fluid as opacity mask.
- 9 new tests for reveal alpha curve math and cover color normalization
  (`src/lib/engine/__tests__/reveal.test.ts`).
- **`<FluidBackground>` component** — full-viewport fluid canvas that sits
  behind page content with automatic DOM element exclusion. Accepts an
  `exclude` CSS selector prop; matched elements become "holes" the fluid
  physically cannot enter. Background-optimized defaults (`simResolution: 64`,
  `dyeResolution: 512`, `initialSplatCount: 0`). See ADR-0026.
- **`/background-fluid` demo route** — prototype page demonstrating
  FluidBackground with 6 feature cards, 5 embedded preset demos, and
  a "How it works" explainer. All cards are excluded from the fluid.
- **Rounded rect shape card** on the main demo page — new "Rounded rect"
  card in the Container shapes section, using `containerShape: { type:
  'roundedRect' }`. Shapes section now has 6 cards (was 5) for symmetric
  2-column layout.
- **`splatOnHover` prop on shape presets** — `CircularFluid`, `FrameFluid`,
  `AnnularFluid`, and `SvgPathFluid` now accept and forward `splatOnHover`.
- **FluidBackground wrapped main demo page** — the main `/` route uses
  `<FluidBackground>` as a page-level background behind all content.
- ADR-0026: FluidBackground component with DOM exclusion zones.

### Changed

- **`transparent` mode now truly transparent** — replaced the checkerboard
  background draw with `gl.clear()` to `(0,0,0,0)`. Canvas CSS background
  is automatically set to `transparent` when `transparent` or `reveal` is
  active. This enables proper alpha compositing with the page.
- **Hero title uses `transparent` mode** — "SVELTE FLUID" text now composites
  directly over the FluidBackground with no opaque rectangle.
- **Demo page pointer-events** — `<main>` set to `pointer-events: none` so
  background fluid splats work across the full page. Interactive elements
  (cards, links, code blocks, playground) re-enable pointer-events.
- Container shapes section description updated: "Five analytical shapes
  plus arbitrary SVG paths" (was "Four").

## [0.1.0] — Unreleased

### Added

- **SVG path container shapes** — new `{ type: 'svgPath' }` variant for
  `containerShape` confines fluid to arbitrary SVG paths or Canvas 2D
  text. Rasterized to a mask texture via `OffscreenCanvas` + `Path2D`.
  Supports `d` (SVG path data), `text` (Canvas2D fillText), `font`,
  `viewBox`, `fillRule`, and `maskResolution` fields. See ADR-0024.
- `SvgPathFluid` preset — fluid shaped by a mask texture (originally a star, now an ampersand glyph).
- `/svelte-fluid` route — "SVELTE FLUID" as fluid-filled text with
  `splatOnHover` interaction.
- `/svg` test route — 4 SVG path test cases (star, heart, rect, evenodd).
- 20 new tests for `svgPath` equality, CPU mask sampling, and
  `maskAreaFraction` (126 total, up from 106).
- **Glass refraction/reflection post-processing layer** — new `glass`
  prop adds a post-processing pass that simulates a glass container over
  the fluid. Two rendering models: **hemisphere orb** (circles) uses
  Snell's law via GLSL `refract()` for physically correct lens distortion
  across the entire surface; **rim model** (frame, roundedRect, annulus,
  svgPath) applies refraction at the container boundary. See ADR-0025.
  - `glass: boolean` (default false) — enables the glass pass. Allocates
    a sceneFBO (RGBA8, canvas resolution) when true.
  - `glassThickness: number` (default 0.04) — rim model band width in UV
    units. Ignored by the orb model. Bucket A.
  - `glassRefraction: number` (default 0.4, 0–1) — distortion strength.
    Mapped to IOR 1.0–2.0. Bucket A.
  - `glassReflectivity: number` (default 0.12, 0–1) — Fresnel F0 for
    specular intensity. Bucket A.
  - `glassChromatic: number` (default 0.15, 0–1) — chromatic aberration
    strength. Splits R/G/B into separate refraction channels. Bucket A.
  - Fluid-driven lighting: all specular and rim glow are modulated by
    the refracted fluid brightness. No fluid = no highlights.
  - New "Container effects" section on demo page with 4 cards: Crystal
    orb, Soft lens, Portal ring, Glass frame.
- **Mouse-tracked specular** — glass specular highlight follows the
  cursor via `uLightScreenPos` uniform. Always-on when glass is active.
- **Glass + transparent mode** — fixed checkerboard routing so `glass`
  and `transparent` work together. Glass shader outputs correct alpha
  per model (edgeFade for orb, glassMask/sdf for rim).
- Playground **glass controls** — ControlPanel gains a "Glass effect"
  section with `glass` toggle and sliders for thickness, refraction,
  reflectivity, chromatic. Auto-sets containerShape to circle when
  glass is toggled on without a shape.
- **Fluid-filled hero title** — home page `<h1>` replaced with two
  Fluid instances rendering "SVELTE" and "FLUID" as svgPath text
  containers with vigorous random splats.
- **Code snippets on demo cards** — Card component gains a `snippet`
  prop with `</>` toggle and Copy button. All 18 demo cards wired with
  copy-pasteable code showing the minimal props to reproduce each effect.
- `splatOnHover` prop — when true, moving the mouse over the canvas
  creates splats without requiring a click. The splat velocity follows
  the cursor movement. Hot-updatable (Bucket A).
- `engines` field in `package.json` (`>=18`).
- npm version badge in README.
- "Why this library?" differentiator section in README.
- Hero GIF showing 4 presets (LavaLamp, Aurora, InkInWater, CircularFluid).
- `/capture` route for recording hero media from a 2×2 preset grid.
- `bun run test` step in CI workflow — 106 tests now run on every push.
- `lazy` prop on `<Fluid />` and all preset wrappers — defers engine
  construction until the container enters the viewport (with a 200px
  rootMargin lookahead) and tears it down when it leaves. Recommended
  for any page with more than ~6 simultaneous instances. Bounds the
  live WebGL context count under the 8–16/tab browser cap.
- `aria-label` forwarding on every preset wrapper for accessibility.
- Demo playground gains a "Reset to defaults" button and a "Copy as
  code" button that emits the current slider state as a
  `<Fluid ... />` snippet.
- Demo gains a "Get started" block with install command and a 3-line
  usage example, plus a header link bar (GitHub, README, Docs,
  Contribute) and a footer link bar (GitHub, Issues, License).
- GitHub Actions CI workflow runs `check`, `prepack`, and `build` on
  every push and pull request.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  GitHub issue templates, and a pull-request template.

### Changed

- Mask texture rasterized at canvas aspect ratio (not always square) —
  fixes vertical squish on non-square canvases for all `svgPath` shapes.
- SVG path mode uniform-scales the path to fit the mask rectangle,
  preserving the path's own aspect ratio with centering.
- Demo "Container shapes" section: 4 → 5 cards (added SVG path star).
  Description updated to mention SVG paths alongside analytical shapes.
- `buildSnippet` in playground `ControlPanel` now emits `randomSplat*`,
  `initialDensity*`, and `splatOnHover` fields when non-default.
- Bloom/sunrays auto-suppress on small canvases (<600px) now applies
  unconditionally — presets that explicitly pass `bloom={true}` no
  longer bypass the guard.
- Demo page: 15 → 21 instances (added 4 "Container effects" cards,
  2 fluid hero title instances). Container shapes description reverted
  from 6 → 5 cards.
- `FluidEngine.drawDisplay()` container shape uniform-setting extracted
  to `setContainerShapeUniforms()` helper, shared with `drawGlass()`.
- Demo page: removed invisible hero background (saved 1 WebGL context),
  reordered sections (presets first), fixed grid to 2 columns (no more
  3+1 asymmetry), moved shape presets to a "Container shapes" subsection
  under Configuration, added `splatOnHover` to config example cards.
- CircularFluid preset: `densityDissipation` 0.08 → 0.15, changed from
  5 splats every 2s to 1 splat every ~0.8s for more organic appearance.
- InkInWater preset: `randomSplatRate` 0.5 → 0.167 (3× slower drops).
- README: added npm/pnpm install options alongside bun, deduplicated
  feature bullets into "Why this library?" section, added `splatOnHover`
  to props table.
- Demo page copy: "seven presets" → "eight", "~28-prop" → "40+",
  `bun add` → `npm install`, rewrote card descriptions from raw prop
  syntax to human-readable prose.
- `RGB` interface now documents per-call-site unit conventions:
  `backColor` is **0–255** (CSS-style, normalized internally),
  `PresetSplat.color` and `FluidHandle.splat` are **0–1** linear with
  HDR allowed. The previous JSDoc on `backColor` incorrectly claimed
  0–1.
- `PresetSplat` docstring corrected: `dx`/`dy` are **not** multiplied
  by `splatForce` (only pointer-driven splats are scaled by it).
- `FluidConfig.pointerInput` is now **hot-updatable** (Bucket A) — the
  engine installs/removes canvas + window listeners on transition.
  Previously the scalar was updated but the listeners were never
  reconciled.
- `package.json` exports map gains `"import"` and `"default"`
  conditions for non-Svelte-aware bundlers (plain Vite, Webpack,
  Rollup, Astro non-Svelte adapters, bare Node imports). Previously
  only `"svelte"` and `"types"` were defined.
- `package.json` `sideEffects` corrected from `["**/*.css"]` (no CSS
  ships) to `false`, enabling full tree-shaking.
- Hero overlay in the demo now has a subtle dark gradient veil so
  foreground text reads against any colored fluid state.
- Demo `+page.svelte` LavaLamp card description corrected from "dim
  purple ambience" to "warm-silver background" (matches the actual
  preset).

### Fixed

- `hdrMultiplier` aspect correction for circle and annulus shapes —
  area fraction now divides by aspect (`pi*r^2 / aspect`), fixing
  over-bright bloom on wide canvases.
- `ShapePreview` outer boundary visibility — 3px translate+scale inset
  prevents frame shapes at `outerHalfW=0.5` from being clipped by the
  card's `overflow: hidden`.
- Default pointer color sentinel `b: 300` → `b: 0` (upstream heritage,
  never rendered, but out-of-range value cleaned up for public API).
- Defensive optional chaining on `pointers[0]` in mouse handlers.
- Try-catch around async dithering texture upload to guard against
  context loss during image decode.
- `pointerInput` hot-update lifecycle — toggling at runtime now
  correctly installs or removes event listeners and drains in-flight
  pointer state.
- Phantom `<meta name="text-scale">` tag removed from `app.html`.

### Documentation

- ADR-0025: Glass refraction/reflection post-processing layer —
  documents the hemisphere orb model, rim model, chromatic aberration,
  fluid-driven lighting, Snell's law refraction, and rejected
  alternatives.
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with glass bucket docs (`glassChromatic`),
  `glass` sceneFBO lifecycle, demo instance count (19).
- ADR-0024: SVG path container shapes via mask texture — documents
  design decision, mask rasterization pipeline, rejected alternatives
  (JFA, analytical SDF, separate shader program).
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with svgPath documentation, mask texture rebuild
  bucket, and demo instance count (15).
- ADR 0005 (hot-update buckets) updated with `initialDensityDissipation`,
  `initialDensityDissipationDuration`, `pointerInput`, and `presetSplats`
  classifications.
- ADR 0001 (bun and uv only) reframed as a project-policy statement
  with the `.npmrc engine-strict=true` mechanism documented.
- `docs/contributing.md` gains a "Hard rules" section listing the five
  non-negotiables: bun-only, runes-only, .js extensions,
  ADR-before-engine-changes, no new runtime deps. Release workflow
  expanded with semver policy and explicit CHANGELOG step.
- `docs/porting-notes.md` "seven preset components" → "six".
- `docs/learnings/presets.md` Plasma sunrays state corrected — Plasma
  keeps sunrays on at weight 0.35, contradicting the previous text.
- `Aurora.svelte` header documents the intentional `sunraysWeight: 1.4`
  trade-off (above the safe ceiling derived in the learnings doc) and
  how to fork to a more restrained version.
